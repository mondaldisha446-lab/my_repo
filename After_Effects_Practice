## UI Motion Practice – After Effects

Today I practiced motion design concepts relevant to UI/UX using Adobe After Effects.

### What I worked on:
- Character-style motion that can be used in onboarding or empty states
- Smooth side-to-side movement and secondary motion (flame / body sway)
- Understanding how motion adds personality and feedback to interfaces
- Exporting motion assets with transparent background for UI use

### Tools:
- Adobe After Effects
- Media Encoder

This practice focuses on improving motion and interaction quality in UI/UX design.
