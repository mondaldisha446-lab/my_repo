## After Effects – Character Animation Practice

Today I worked on animating a simple character in Adobe After Effects.

### What I learned:
- Basic character animation (body and flame movement)
- Pre-compositions and layer control
- Exporting animation with transparent background
- Difference between Media Encoder and After Effects Render Queue
- Exporting using Apple ProRes 4444 with Alpha channel

This is part of my daily practice as I’m learning motion graphics and animation.
