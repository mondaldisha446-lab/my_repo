This repository showcases my practice of Python fundamentals.
The goal is to build a strong programming foundation while maintaining clean, readable, and well-organized code.
My background in UI/UX design influences how I approach code — with an emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and structure.
This repository will be updated regularly as I continue learning and improving.
